# lib_utils
Miscellaneous utility functions.
   
## Description
Not much more to say.  I wrote the functions in this crate to help with other projects on which I am working.  

## Word of Caution
These functions tend to be weak on error handling.  My suggestion is to copy the code into your project and then modify from there.  Better than building from scratch.  I think.  Have fun!

## Documentation
Sorry about the lack of documentation.  However, the function names pretty much tell you what they do.  Most of them are quite short, so it shouldn't be too hard for you to figure out their purpose.
